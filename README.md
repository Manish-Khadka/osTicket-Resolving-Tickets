To create tickets, users must access the ticket portal and log in if needed. Once in the portal, users can submit a ticket request and describe their IT-related issues. In this lab, I’ve created three tickets covering a range of problems that could arise in a real environment. Tickets are created by selecting a Help Topic, providing a brief description of the issue, and detailing the problem in a format similar to an email.

From an admin's perspective, ticket requests appear in the admin panel once submitted. The admin can then reassign tickets to the appropriate agent or team. The severity level of each issue is evaluated and assigned to ensure tickets are addressed within the specified SLA. In this case, Manish reviewed the ticket, assigned it to the System Administrators team, and updated the severity level to Emergency.

Effective communication is essential when resolving tickets. It's important to communicate clearly with both the team and the affected users. Tickets vary in nature and are assigned to the appropriate individuals based on the issue. Proper documentation is key to a successful workflow. Each ticket should be documented thoroughly to serve as a reference if a similar issue arises in the future.

<h2>Lesson Learned<h2>

The protocols for managing tickets can vary depending on the work environment. There may be set quotas for resolving a certain number of tickets within a specific time frame, and some tickets may need to be prioritized based on the situation. By building osTicket from scratch, I gained a deeper understanding of how ticketing systems operate in an IT role.
